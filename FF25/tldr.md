Based on FF25 support forum questions these are the changes that fortunately are covered in today's roadmap

* sync: Create a user friendly sync on all our products.
* more-splendid-ux: Keep our open web user experience ahead of others by addressing user issues with top sites and bookmarks.
* webcompat: Continue to promote and implement open web standards so websites and apps work everywhere.
* video: Make the mobile video experience work better with our without Flash and perhaps with Shumway

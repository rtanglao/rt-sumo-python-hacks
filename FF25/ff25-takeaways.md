# Positives

No major bugs without viable workarounds (except for flash video on KitKat). Users like Mozilla and what we stand for. No major crashes or slowness.


# Issues

Webcompatibility is something we need to educate users about! As well as developers.

Webcompatibility, user experience, sync and video flash or otherwise are the big issues.

User experience around bookmarks, top sites, etc is confusing. Top
sites is not something users get; instead some even refer it it incorrectly as a top list. De-emphasize this or perhaps this is something that will go away as people get familiar with the top sites concept from desktop? 
Or have the ability to kill Top Sites
altogether as part of upcoming my list feature.

Flash video is still a nightmare. Shumway could help but only if it degrades gracefully since there is no way we can play back all the flash video on initial Shumway release.

Finally, sync is hard to setup, hard to understand (users think it is a backup service) and hard to restore or to setup with a new device or desktop.

User Education can help with all of the above.

# Lessons for Firefox OS

We have to nail the sync experience because it would be huge to have it work well in version 1.0 of sync for FF OS between FFOS, android and desktop

We have to continue to polish the ux around bookmarks, top sites, etc and make it more intuitive or document it better on first run.

# What's not in the roadmap?

* Shumway - not firm
* Sync.next - not firm

#tl;dr

If we can create a user friendlysync on all three products and keep our open web user experience ahead of others (which includes promoting open web standards so websites and apps work everywhere) and make the mobile video experience work splendidly without flash, then our users will continue to be delighted.

# Positives

No major bugs without viable workarounds (except for flash video on KitKat). Users like Mozilla and what we stand for. No major crashes or slowness.


# Issues

Webcompatibility is something we need to educate users about! As well as developers.

Webcompatibility, user experience, sync and video/flash or otherwise are the top issues.

The User Experience around bookmarks, top sites, etc is confusing for many users.. Top
sites is not something users understand intuitively; instead some even refer it it incorrectly as a top list. De-emphasize this or perhaps this is something that will go away as people get familiar with the top sites concept from desktop? 
Or have the ability to disable or remove Top Sites
altogether as part of upcoming "My lists" feature.

Flash video is still a nightmare. Shumway could help but only if it degrades gracefully since there is no way we can play back all the flash video on initial Shumway release.

Finally, sync is hard to setup, hard to understand (users think it is a backup service and don't understand our current account-less implementation) and hard to restore or to setup with a new device or desktop.

User Education can help with all of the above.

# Lessons for Firefox OS

We have to nail the sync experience because it would be a big win to have sync work well in version 1.0 of sync.next for FF OS between FFOS, android and desktop.

We have to continue to polish the ux around bookmarks, top sites, etc and make it more intuitive or document it better on first run.

And finally a world of websites and apps powered by open standards helps Firefox OS as well as our other products.

# What's not in the roadmap?

* Shumway - not firm
* Sync.next - not firm

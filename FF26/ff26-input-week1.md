# Selected Verbatims

1. **2013-12-12T10:30:51** [I do like it but I do wish it was more like the desktop version since I use on a tablet, I would like to be able to set a home page, and I do not like having to check the request a desktop site every time I open a new tab](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4112186), #ux, #requestdesktopsite, #homepage, #awesomescreen
2. **2013-12-12T12:14:34** [challenged with web cast content requiring flash player not compatible with Android.](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4112333), #flash, #video
3. **2013-12-12T10:05:04** [a site shows on my main page and I can not remove it, the clear private data does not work](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4112137), #privacy, #homepage, #awesomescreen
4. **2013-12-12T07:03:27** [Please let us disable Top Sites! It destroys privacy and puts every bookmark one tap further away.](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4111887), #ux, #topsites, #homepage, #awesomescreen
5. **2013-12-12T04:14:08** [ Managing bookmarks is more difficult than before. If I go to website homepage, then to a topic page, then bookmark. When I return with the bookmark, I get the homepage only not the topic page. Always got the topic page in prior versions of this browser. Also have difficulty finding a way to delete that saved bookmark.](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4111669), #bookmarks, #ux, #topsites, #homepage, #awesomescreen

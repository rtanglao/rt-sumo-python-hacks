# Selected Verbatims

1. **2013-12-12T10:30:51** [I do like it but I do wish it was more like the desktop version since I use on a tablet, I would like to be able to set a home page, and I do not like having to check the request a desktop site every time I open a new tab](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4112186), #ux, #requestdesktopsite, #homepage, #awesomescreen
2. **2013-12-12T12:14:34** [challenged with web cast content requiring flash player not compatible with Android.](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4112333), #flash, #video
3. **2013-12-12T10:05:04** [a site shows on my main page and I can not remove it, the clear private data does not work](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4112137), #privacy, #homepage, #awesomescreen
4. **2013-12-12T07:03:27** [Please let us disable Top Sites! It destroys privacy and puts every bookmark one tap further away.](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4111887), #ux, #topsites, #homepage, #awesomescreen
5. **2013-12-12T04:14:08** [ Managing bookmarks is more difficult than before. If I go to website homepage, then to a topic page, then bookmark. When I return with the bookmark, I get the homepage only not the topic page. Always got the topic page in prior versions of this browser. Also have difficulty finding a way to delete that saved bookmark.](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4111669), #bookmarks, #ux, #topsites, #homepage, #awesomescreen
6. **2013-12-11T23:11:03** [My problems are more of a settings issue which for me wouldn't have this browser as default. -option to always have desktop view always on is the big one. -option to always have the title bar shown at the top. If I'm in the middle of a page and see something I need to look up for reference, having to scroll up to the top to open another tab is not ideal. I lose my place of where I was.

7. **2013-12-11T20:45:39** [...Firefox on my Mac has a setting that defaults new pages to private mode. should add that here](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4111226), #privacy, #ux
8. **2013-12-11T21:53:57** [I get occasional crashes from time to time; other than that I love it.](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4111282)
9. **2013-12-11T16:40:22** [I'm quite sick of random text-size changes on sites like reddit. I mostly use Firefox over chrome because ff is not quite as bad, but it's still annoying. Apparently it's supposed to help adjust text for small screens; I don't care. It's not worth it. Other than that, it's been great.](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4110970)
10. **2013-12-11T14:35:07**  [there is no Exit button!!? so I have to tap several times exit... but if I opened many sites, I have to click too many time exit button!? and there is no straight back to Home page!](https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboard/response/4110836)
